**Laboratory Report #2 – Generating Tests Based on Requirements**

# 1 Introduction

The goal of this project was to deepen our grasp of the principles behind automated unit testing. We engaged with the JUnit framework, part of the XUnit suite, which is prevalent for unit testing in Java. Our activities included writing automated tests using JUnit and employing mock objects to facilitate our testing efforts using JMock.
Initially, our comprehension of automated unit testing and black-box testing was confined to the topics covered in classroom lectures. We understood that JUnit is a framework designed for Java that supports extensive automated testing and is broadly adopted across the industry. We also recognized that Javadoc is a documentation tool that provides detailed information on the software under test, and that it's crucial to consult the Javadoc for extracting requirement specifications to craft test suites.
JUnit testing involves using annotations to manage the test execution flow and assertions to assess the behavior of the test subject. Mock objects are simulated Java classes that stand in for external dependencies, which are excluded from unit tests to isolate the functionality being tested. Black-box testing allows for the design of JUnit test plans and cases based on the requirements alone, without knowledge of the code. Techniques for black-box design include equivalence class and boundary value testing.
Although these concepts were introduced in the classroom, for many of us, it was our first experience with conducting automated unit testing using JUnit, employing JMock for mock object creation and utilization, and developing black-box unit tests derived from Javadoc requirements.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

We employed distinct testing strategies for the Range and DataUtilities classes due to their differing functionalities. The initial phase in test plan formulation involved selecting suitable input parameter domains for each class. For the Range class test cases, we chose a variety of domain ranges, allowing for a comprehensive test coverage including positive, negative, and zero values.

In the DataUtilities class test cases, we utilized jMock to simulate the Values2D and KeyedValues classes. The Values2D instance was mocked as a 2-dimensional matrix with dimensions of 2 rows by 2 columns. These domain values facilitated the segmentation into equivalence classes for testing, as well as the identification of boundary values for boundary testing.

## Range Class
Test ranges of mostly 1 to 5, and 1 to 20 were used. Depending on the specific test scenario, additional ranges were formulated to cater to more targeted test cases.

#### **Table 1.** Boundary Value Testing - Domain Table for Range Class 1 to 5 
| Boundary Value (BVT) Notation      | Value      |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------:|
| BLB (just below lower boundary)    | 0.999 |
| LB (lower boundary)                | 1       |
| ALB (just above lower boundary)    | 1.001  |
| Nominal Value(s)                   | 1 to 5  |
| BUB (just below upper boundary)    | 4.999   |
| UB (upper boundary)                | 5        |
| AUB (just above upper boundary)    | 5.001  |

#### **Table 2.** Boundary Value Testing - Domain Table for Range Class 1 to 20
| Boundary Value (BVT) Notation      | Value      |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------:|
| BLB (just below lower boundary)    | 0.999 |
| LB (lower boundary)                | 1       |
| ALB (just above lower boundary)    | 1.001  |
| Nominal Value(s)                   | 1 to 20  |
| BUB (just below upper boundary)    | 19.999   |
| UB (upper boundary)                | 20        |
| AUB (just above upper boundary)    | 20.001  |


## DataUtilities Class
For DataUtilities class test scenarios, the primary consideration was the dimensionality of the mocked Values2D matrix. Additional testing criteria were developed for specific test scenarios as needed. It's crucial to note that testing certain boundary values (e.g., a matrix dimension of 0 or -1) was not feasible.

#### **Table 3.** Boundary Value Testing - Domain Table for DataUtilities Class
| Boundary Value (BVT) Notation      | Value                                        |
|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| BLB (just below lower boundary)    | -1                                           |
| LB (lower boundary)                | 0                                            |
| ALB (just above lower boundary)    | 1                                            |
| Nominal Value(s)                   | Values between (but not including) 0 and 2   |
| BUB (just below upper boundary)    | 1                                            |
| UB (upper boundary)                | 2                                            |
| AUB (just above upper boundary)    | 3                                            |

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

For this assignment, our group divided the work so that we each tested methods from each class “Range” and “DataUtilities” of the JFreeChart library. We collected our results and shared them with the rest of the team for review. 

####  Team Work Outline

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

We overcame the difficulties of reading Javadocs. 
The team learned about how to perform black-box testing by extracting the specifications of the system from the documentation and coming up with appropriate equivalence classes and boundary conditions. Figuring out which equivalence classes and boundaries should be tested and which ones where possible to test was quite challenging. 
Finally, understanding that the DataUtilities methods were defective was difficult to realize at first. We especially faced difficulty with `DataUtilities.getCumulativePercentages()` .

# 6 Conclusion

Our experience with JUnit and automated unit testing has significantly broadened our understanding and skills in software testing. The practical application of theory through the development of test cases based on Javadoc requirements has emphasized the importance of thorough and methodical testing practices. While we encountered challenges, such as understanding the nuances of mock object creation and the intricacies of boundary value testing, these obstacles served as valuable learning opportunities. The project highlighted the critical role of automated testing in ensuring software reliability and functionality. Moving forward, we aim to integrate the lessons learned from this project into our future software development endeavors, with a heightened focus on the essential principles of unit testing and test-driven development.
